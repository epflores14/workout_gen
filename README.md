What the code allows you to do:
Upon user input of fitness level (Beginner, intermediate, and advanced),
it gives you the number of sets and reps of a workout and what workouts to do per body part 
(arms, legs, back, shoulders, chest, abs). It also allows you to see which branch of AnyTime Fitness you can workout
out of a randomization option. It allows for customization as well, since you can add body parts, workouts, 
and gym branches to choose from.

Aside from this, the program allows you to save the workout as a CSV file 
and plots a bar plot of the amount of times you workout the 6 body parts for comparison, 
especially useful to know which body parts are lacking. 

Code is continuously being improved upon by uploader.
